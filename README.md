Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.Involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.Its important in creation of software products and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.(1) The 1968 NATO conference where the term software engineering was coined.(2) Development of Object oriented programming.It promoted modularity and reusability in the 1970s and 1980s.(3) Agile manifesto in 2001.promoted flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.(1) Requirements analysis -gathering and analyzing needs of stakeholders.(2) Design - creating a blueprint architecture of the system.(3) Implementation - writing the actual code based design and customer collaboration.(4)Testing-verifying the software works as intended and is free of bugs.(5) Deployment-Releasing the software for use.(6)Maintenance- bug fixes and updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Agile is iterative and incremental approaching to project management and software development while waterfall is linear and sequential in approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.Agile is suitable for projects with evolving requirements while waterfall is suitable for projects with well defined requirements and minimal changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
(1) Software developer -writes codes, implements features and fixes bugs.
(2) Quality Assurance Engineer -Tests software and ensures it meets quality standards and is free from defects.(3) Project manager -Oversees the project, manages resources and ensures the team meets its goals.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.- IDEs like Visual studio provide a comprehensive environment for coding, debugging and testing enhancing productivity.VCS like Git track changes in code, enable collaboration and managa version history.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.-
Managing complex codebases and keeping up with rapidly evolving technology.Strategies include Continuous learning and using modern tools for code management.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.-(1)Unit testing -testing individual components or functions.(2) Integration testing-ensuring different modules work together.(3) System testing-testing the complete system as a whole.(4) Acceptance testing-validating that the system meets user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.-Its crafting inputs that guide AI models to produce desired outputs.It improves the accuracy, relevance and usefulness of AI responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.- (1)Vague prompt-Teach me about software engineering.(2)Improved prompt-Explain the key principles of software engineering.(3) The improved prompt is clear and specific.
